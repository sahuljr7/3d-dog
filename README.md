# 3d-dog

Let's create a 3D dog model that matches this reference:

```typescriptreact project="3d-dog"
...
```

This implementation recreates the dog model from the reference image with the following key features:

1. Low-poly geometric style using cylinder geometries for different body parts
2. Black color with visible wireframe overlay
3. Proper positioning and rotation of body parts to match the reference
4. Grid helper with orange lines matching the reference
5. Light gray background
6. Shadows and lighting setup
7. OrbitControls for interactive viewing


The model is constructed using:

- Cylindrical geometries for the body, head, snout, legs, and tail
- Two materials per mesh:

- A solid black material for the base
- A wireframe material for the geometric overlay



- Proper transformations to position and rotate each part
- Shadow casting and receiving for realism


You can interact with the model using:

- Left mouse button to rotate
- Right mouse button to pan
- Scroll wheel to zoom


Let me know if you'd like any adjustments to make it match the reference more closely!
